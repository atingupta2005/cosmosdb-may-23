Why PITR not working?

Dedicated Gateway for Caching
Implement security
- Also if is it possible to specify multiple column names as partition key

------ Nice to have---------
Handle connection errors
Implement threading and parallelism
Configure logging
cross-document transactional operations
change feed

Sanity checks after PITR is done. Can prepare checklist before releasing to the team.
